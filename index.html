                        Layers: “Rareawhere” follows the story of a new student named Cambi in Rareawhere High School, though the school can’t decide which classes he should attend, so he switches every day! 
                        
                        <br><span class="rwq">And how is RAREAWHERE related?</span><br>
                        RAREAWHERE takes place just as SURREALITY (chapter 1) begins. This short game focuses on Cambie's perspective of the chapter 1 events, and how he interacts with Dave, Masie, and... Kaisei?
