            <p class="h">what is <span>studiogpb</span>?</p>
            <p>StudioGPB is the (not yet) publisher of "<span>Layers</span>", "<span>HT-L-A-Q-</span>", and more!</p>

            <p class="h"><span>layers</span> of what?</p>
            <p>Layers is a 4-Chapter game about discovering and adventuring a whole new world, the <span>Layers</span> world.<br> 
                You are <span>Dave</span>, a young kid who loves making friends but hates talking.<br>
                Your friends are <span>Sevil and Masie</span>. Play "<span>SURREALITY</span>" to learn about them.
                Oh, and by the way, <br><span class="scary">SACRIFICES ARE NEEDED.</span></p>
            
            <p class="h">what is <span>"HT-L-A-Q-"?</span></p>
            <p><span>HT-L-A-Q-</span> (aka "<span>How To Live And Question</span>") is a short story about a <span>ghost</span>, forced
                <br>to explore the dreams of the abused <span>slaves</span><br> that <span>died</span> 
                during experiments many years ago.<br>Inspired heavily by a dream during the night of <span class="scary">14/12/2024</span>.</p>
